  cd zombies-api
  npm i
  cp .env.dist .env
  docker-compose up -d
```

**Please remember that `.env` must be implemented for proper work.**

## üìú Scripts

### Build

- `build`: Builds production ready application.

- `start`: Start production ready environment. Must be preceded by a `build` script.

- `docker-build-prod`: Builds production ready docker image for API.

### Test

- `test`: Run `jest` in standard mode.
- `test:watch`: Run `jest` in watch mode.
- `test:ci`: Run `jest` for CI purposes with coverage and database as docker container.

### Analyze

- `typecheck`: Run `typescript` in dry-mode (no output). Type errors will be printed to console.
- `format`: Run `prettier` to format all files. Gets invoked by the pre-commit hook.
- `lint`: Run `eslint` and `prettier`. Output any errors.

### Development

- `dev`: Run application in development mode by using `nodemon`.
- `version`: Generates `CHANGELOG` file based on commit messages.

## üìè Rules

This project follows clean architecture rules. Each of the layers communicates with each other using abstraction and the lower layers know nothing about the upper layers.

![Clean architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*JD606Sqx6RYZLKdu.)

We can distinguish four layers in this repository:

- `api` - here a server is prepared to communicate with the outside world using the REST API powered by `express`. With the lower layer it communicates only using the `command bus` and `query bus`.

- `app` - this layer is responsible for the implementation of commands and queries available in the application. According to the CQRS pattern.

- `infrastructure` - layer responsible for concrete implementations of external tools, e.g. persistence layer is implemented using postgresql.

- `core` - layer that is responsible for creating and managing domain objects.
